## Objectives
- Draw simple wireframes to mock up a front-end page.

## Prerequisites
- None

## Sketching and Wireframing
### What is a wireframe?
A **wireframe** is an image that sketches out the layout of major pieces of content within a page, without all of the fully-rendered detail that might be present in an illustation. Although making detailed, feature-rich wireframes is typically the province of the UX/UI designer, even developers can produce basic layout sketches, and these sketches are extremely useful in the planning process as a tool to clarify and codify your vision. They also segue easily into the **box model**, a paradigm for actually constructing layouts in HTML and CSS (more on this later).

Within the scope of this course, we will not be expecting you to produce designer-level wireframes; however, we _will_ be expecting you to produce low-fidelity sketches for your projects. A good sketch is simple, but just complex enough to convey the gist of the page. It may feature minimal text, or interactive features like drop-down menus and pop-ups/modals. Below are some examples of sketches that have been submitted by students in previous cohorts. Some are high fidelity and some are lower; some were drawn by hand and some were drawn using design tools like Balsamiq; however, all of the following would be cosidered acceptable as far as WDI projects are concerned.

A wireframe should typically _**not**_ concern itself with things like
* color scheme
* fonts
* specific content (images, written copy, etc)
* animations and timing

If you find yourself diving into those details, you've gone too deep. The purpose of a sketch is to be light, flexible, and even disposable if necessary.


#### Lab :: Sketching and Wireframing
**Individually**, pick one of the eight following sites and draw a basic sketch for the site on a patch of whiteboard. Focus on capturing the key elements of layout for the page, but **DO NOT INCLUDE ANY TEXT**. When you're finished, rotate within your squads, and see if you can identify your teammate's site by their sketch.
